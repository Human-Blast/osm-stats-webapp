### Firebase Config

  FirebaseConfig.js file containing all the api keys isn;t currently in the repo for security and internal testing purpose.
  You can add your own api keys by creating a file in src/ 'firebaseconfig.js' and having the following code
  
  ```js
  export default {
    apiKey: "API Key",
    authDomain: "Auth Domain",
    databaseURL: "DB URL",
    projectId: "Project Id",
    storageBucket: "Storage Bucket",
    appId: "App Id"
};
  ```
